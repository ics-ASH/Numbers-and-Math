**Rectangle Area Assignment**</p>
-
Create a file that prompts the user for a length and width of a rectangle and then displays the area and the perimeter. Convert the user's answers to integers before calculating area and perimeter. If you can't remember the area and perimeter formulas of a rectangle, look them up online. </p>

**Sample Output**<br/>
Enter a length: 10.5<br/>
Enter a width: 4.2<br/>
The area is 44 and the perimeter is 29.<br/>

Submit your work.

**Total Distance**</p>
-
Create a file that prompts the user for three segment lengths of a race and then calculates the total distance. The race segments can have lengths that contain a decimal portion. Create appropriate variables. Use string formatting for the output.</p>
**Sample Output<br/>**
First length is 8.5<br/>
Second length is 6.0<br/>
Third length is 7.3<br/><br/>
Total Distance is 21.8.</p>

Notice that there is a blank line between the 3rd and 4th statement. You can insert this by typing a blank print statement:</p>

- **print()**

Submit your code.

**Object Height**</p>
-

If a rock falls from a height of 100 meters on Earth, the height H (in meters) after t seconds is approximately H(t)=100-4.9 t^{2}H(t)=100âˆ’4.9t 
2
  
The height of an object at any given time dropped from a starting height of 100 meters is given by the equation:<br/>

`h = 100 - 4.9 * t ** 2`<br/>

where h is height and t is time in seconds</p>

Create an application that prompts the user for a time less than 4.5 seconds and then displays the height of the object at that time.</p>

**Sample Output**</p>

Enter a time in seconds: 3<br/>
The height of the object at 3 seconds is 55.9 meters.

**Temp Conversion**</p>
-
Create an application that prompts the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit then converts it to degrees Celsius. Use the formula:</p>

` C = 5/9 * (F - 32)`</P>

**Sample Output**</p>

Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 50<br/>
The temperature in Celsius is: 10</p>

Submit your code.

**Pizza Cost**</p>
-
Create a Pizza Cost application that prompts the user for the size of a pizza in inches, and then displays the cost of making the pizza.</p>
Here's what you need to know:</p>
- labour cost is $0.75 per pizza
- rent cost is $1.00 per pizza
- material cost is $0.05 * diameter^2
</p>

**Example**</p>
If the user enters 10 for the size of the pizza, then the cost will be:</p>

- 0.75 + 1 + 0.05 * 10 ^ 2 </p>

**Note:** In Python you would write an exponent using \**. <br/>
- For example, 10 to the power of 2 would be 10 ** 2.
</p>

**Sample Output**</p>

What size pizza in inches would you like?  8<br/>
The total cost of your pizza is: $4.95
